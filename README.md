# Driving Test Webscraper

**Driving Test Webscraper** is a tool designed to monitor and scrape new open test booking slots from [LIDT.co.uk](https://www.lidt.co.uk). This tool helps users find and book driving test slots by continuously checking for availability and notifying them of new openings. Additionally, it uses cookies to automate the booking process for the user once a slot is found.

## Features

- **Automated Slot Monitoring:** Regularly scrapes LIDT.co.uk for new driving test booking slots.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Alerts users when new slots become available.
- **Automatic Booking:** Uses cookies to reserve a slot on behalf of the user.
- **Customizable Scraping Interval:** Allows users to set how frequently the scraper checks for new slots.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple configuration and usage to get started quickly.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **BeautifulSoup4** (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- **Requests** (`pip install requests`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/driving-test-webscraper.git](https://github.com/sudhakara-ambati/driving-test-aggregator)
    cd driving-test-webscraper
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**


3. **Run the Webscraper:**

    ```bash
    python lidt.py
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Scraping and Monitoring:**
    - The scraper periodically checks LIDT.co.uk for available driving test slots.
    - When a new slot is detected, the scraper will send a real-time email notification to the user.

2. **Using Cookies for Booking:**
    - **Session Management:** When a user initiates a booking, the scraper first logs into LIDT.co.uk using the user's credentials (if required). It stores session cookies to maintain an authenticated state.
    - **Cookie Handling:** The scraper uses these cookies to perform automated interactions with the LIDT booking system. This includes navigating to the booking page and selecting the desired test slot.
    - **Slot Reservation:** Upon finding an available slot, the scraper uses the stored cookies to submit a booking request on behalf of the user. This automates the reservation process by bypassing manual form submissions and interactions.

- **lidt.py:** Main script for scraping LIDT.co.uk, handling cookies, and sending notifications.
